## Component Library

- { children } : If you every create a custom component and place anything inside of those tags, that text is going to be automatically and provided as a prop with a very special name called 'children'
#### NOTE: If you ever pass down a prop that has a boolean value, example: primary={true}, we could just write it down as primary or the prop name.
- prop-type : JS librabry to validate the props that get passed into your component. If someone passes down the incorrect kind of value, a warning will appear in console.
- Install: npm install prop-types

### Accordions
